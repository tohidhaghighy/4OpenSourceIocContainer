# StructureMap

tructureMap 3.0 released in early 2014 marked a huge change in the StructureMap internals and public API's. The 4.0 release was a much smaller release that primarily improved type scanning, diagnostics, and performance. The only breaking changes from 3 to 4 were in custom type scanning conventions, the removal of ObjectFactory, and the elimination of some obscure configuration API's.
